# -esk-Token - ERC-20 based stable coin tied to Czech crown

## Pegging Mechanism

### Collateralized Approach:
- **Direct Peg to CZK:** Each ČToken is pegged 1:1 to the Czech Koruna, ensuring that for every ČToken issued, an equivalent amount in CZK or CZK-denominated assets is held as collateral.
- **Collateral Management:** The collateral is stored in a regulated and audited manner, typically involving a mix of bank deposits and short-term government securities, aligning with EU regulatory standards.
- **Transparency:** Audited reports of the reserve holdings are published regularly to maintain transparency and trust.

### Stability Mechanism

#### Reserve Management:
- **Over-Collateralization:** ČToken is over-collateralized, holding more than 1 CZK in value for each ČToken to account for market fluctuations and ensure stability.
- **Risk Management:** Risk management strategies are implemented to protect the reserve against market volatility, thus ensuring the stability of the peg.

#### Algorithmic Assistance:
- **Supplementary Algorithms:** Smart contracts are used to manage the supply of ČToken in response to market conditions, with collateral serving as the primary stability mechanism.

## Additional Features

### Governance:
- **Decentralized Governance Model:** A governance model is in place that involves ČToken holders in decision-making processes, such as reserve management or future upgrades.
- **Compliance Focus:** The governance model adheres to regulatory requirements.

### Regulatory Compliance:
- **AML/KYC Integration:** AML/KYC procedures are integrated for transactions converting ČToken to fiat, complying with European and Czech regulations.
- **Legal Framework Adherence:** Continuous monitoring and adaptation to regulatory changes, especially those affecting stablecoins, are maintained.

### User Incentives:
- **Staking Rewards:** Rewards are offered for users who stake ČToken, contributing to the liquidity and stability of the stablecoin.
